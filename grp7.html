        <h2>Home Page by Group 7</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our homepage dedicated to highlighting the importance of safety gear across various fields of Industrial Arts. From civil engineering to plumbing, automotive work, and electrical installations, safety gear plays a crucial role in ensuring the well-being of workers and preventing accidents on the job. Join us as we explore the significance of safety equipment in these industries and raise awareness about the importance of prioritizing safety in all aspects of industrial work.
</p>  

        <h2>1. Civil Engineering:</h2>
        <img src="416786609_1433432580581472_6319262995131085376_n.jpg" alt="">
        <p> - Civil engineering involves the design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure projects such as buildings, bridges, roads, and dams.</p>
        <p> - In this field, safety gear such as hard hats, safety glasses, gloves, and steel-toed boots are essential to protect workers from falling debris, hazardous materials, and other on-site dangers.</p>
        <p> - Safety equipment also includes harnesses, safety ropes, and barricades for working at heights and in hazardous areas.</p>

        <h2>2. Plumbing:</h2>
        <img src="432484233_775749731162214_382110934623312904_n.jpg" alt="">
        <p> - Plumbing focuses on the installation, maintenance, and repair of plumbing systems in buildings, including water supply, drainage, and sewage systems.
            </p>
        <p> - Plumbers utilize safety gear such as protective eyewear, gloves, and masks to safeguard against exposure to chemicals, sewage, and other harmful substances.</p>
        <p>  - Additionally, safety equipment like knee pads and back supports help prevent strains and injuries during prolonged periods of kneeling or lifting heavy objects.</p>
 
        <h2>3. Automotive:</h2>
